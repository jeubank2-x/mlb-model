    "text": "This project focuses on identifying MLB players who present value opportunities based on their recent and season-long performance metrics. The goal is to use statistical analysis to highlight high-potential outcomes. Home Runs (HR) are used as the primary example, but the process can extend to other stats such as stolen bases, strikeouts, or on-base percentage.\nPreliminary Definitions:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMetric\nDefinition\n\n\n\n\nHR/PA\nHome Runs per Plate Appearance. Measures how often a batter hits home runs.\n\n\nLeague HR/PA\nAverage home run rate per plate appearance across all MLB batters.\n\n\nHR/IP\nHome Runs allowed per Inning Pitched. Measures how often a pitcher allows HRs.\n\n\nLeague HR/IP\nAverage HR/IP across all MLB pitchers.\n\n\nBarrel %\nPercentage of batted balls classified as barrels (optimal exit velocity + launch angle).\n\n\nHard Hit %\nPercentage of a batter’s batted balls hit at 95+ mph.\n\n\nIndex\nPlayer’s HR/PA (or HR/IP) divided by the league average. Above 1.0 indicates above-average performance or susceptibility.\n\n\n\nData Preprocessing & Cross-Matching:\n```r library(readr) library(tidyverse)\n\nRead in data\nbatters &lt;- read_csv(“~/Downloads/stats.csv”) batters_recent &lt;- read_csv(“~/Downloads/savant_data.csv”) pitchers &lt;- read_csv(“~/Downloads/stats (1).csv”)\n\n\nFilter missing data\nbatters_recent &lt;- batters_recent %&gt;% filter(player_id != 660644) %&gt;% mutate(hr_per_pa = hrs / pa)\n\n\nCalculate player metrics\nbatters &lt;- batters %&gt;% mutate(hr_per_pa = home_run / pa) pitchers &lt;- pitchers %&gt;% mutate(hr_per_ip = home_run / p_formatted_ip)\n\n\nLeague averages and index\nbatters_recent &lt;- batters_recent %&gt;% mutate(avg = sum(hrs) / sum(pa), index = hr_per_pa / avg)\nbatters &lt;- batters %&gt;% mutate(avg = sum(home_run) / sum(pa), index = hr_per_pa / avg)\npitchers &lt;- pitchers %&gt;% mutate(avg = sum(home_run) / sum(p_formatted_ip), index = hr_per_ip / avg)\n\n\nFilter players with above-average performance or susceptibility\nbatters_recent_filtered &lt;- batters_recent %&gt;% filter(index &gt; 1) batters_filtered &lt;- batters %&gt;% filter(index &gt; 1) pitchers_filtered &lt;- pitchers %&gt;% filter(index &gt; 1)\nExample Calculation: Player A: 25 HR in 500 PA → HR/PA = 0.05 League HR/PA = 0.035 → Batter Index = 0.05 ÷ 0.035 = 1.43\nPitcher B: 20 HR in 150 IP → HR/IP = 0.133 League HR/IP = 0.09 → Pitcher Index = 0.133 ÷ 0.09 = 1.48\nSince both indices &gt; 1.0, the matchup is flagged as high value.\nHigh-Value Matchups: # Combine batter data good_batters &lt;- inner_join(batters_filtered, batters_recent_filtered, by = “player_id”)\n\n\nFilter today’s pitchers\npitchers_today &lt;- read_csv(“~/Downloads/todays_pitchers_names_only.csv”) bad_pitchers &lt;- inner_join(pitchers_filtered, pitchers_today, by = c(“last_name”, “first_name”))\n\n\nSelect relevant columns\ngood_batters &lt;- good_batters %&gt;% select(last_name, first_name, player_id, ab, pa.x, pa.y, hit, home_run, hard_hit_percent)\nbad_pitchers &lt;- bad_pitchers %&gt;% select(last_name, first_name, player_id, p_formatted_ip, home_run, hr_per_ip, barrel_batted_rate, exit_velocity_avg, batting_avg)\nThese tables allow you to identify good batters versus susceptible pitchers using any MLB schedule. Additional metrics like hard hit % can be used to refine player selection.\n\n\nResults (08/09/2025):\nMetric Predicted Actual High Value Batters 3 of 13 correct Good Batters 18 of 52 correct\nThe model captured several statistically advantageous matchups, demonstrating potential for predicting HR outcomes.\nConclusion: The model successfully identifies statistically favorable batter-pitcher matchups. Although Home Runs were used as the main example, the same framework can extend to other performance metrics. Limitations include small sample sizes and rapidly changing player performance. Future improvements could include incorporating park factors, weighting recent stats more heavily than season averages, using multiple metrics simultaneously, and implementing machine learning for enhanced predictions."
