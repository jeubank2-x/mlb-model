This project focuses on identifying MLB players who present value opportunities based on their recent and season-long performance metrics. The goal is to use statistical analysis to highlight high-potential outcomes. Home Runs (HR) are used as the primary example, but the process can extend to other stats such as stolen bases, strikeouts, or on-base percentage.

Preliminary Definitions:

| Metric | Definition |
|--------|------------|
| HR/PA | Home Runs per Plate Appearance. Measures how often a batter hits home runs. |
| League HR/PA | Average home run rate per plate appearance across all MLB batters. |
| HR/IP | Home Runs allowed per Inning Pitched. Measures how often a pitcher allows HRs. |
| League HR/IP | Average HR/IP across all MLB pitchers. |
| Barrel % | Percentage of batted balls classified as barrels (optimal exit velocity + launch angle). |
| Hard Hit % | Percentage of a batter’s batted balls hit at 95+ mph. |
| Index | Player's HR/PA (or HR/IP) divided by the league average. Above 1.0 indicates above-average performance or susceptibility. |

Data Processing & Cross-Matching:


# Read in data

# Filter missing data
batters_recent <- batters_recent %>%
  filter(player_id != 660644) %>%
  mutate(hr_per_pa = hrs / pa)

# Calculate player metrics
batters <- batters %>% mutate(hr_per_pa = home_run / pa)
pitchers <- pitchers %>% mutate(hr_per_ip = home_run / p_formatted_ip)

# League averages and index
batters_recent <- batters_recent %>%
  mutate(avg = sum(hrs) / sum(pa),
         index = hr_per_pa / avg)

batters <- batters %>%
  mutate(avg = sum(home_run) / sum(pa),
         index = hr_per_pa / avg)

pitchers <- pitchers %>%
  mutate(avg = sum(home_run) / sum(p_formatted_ip),
         index = hr_per_ip / avg)

# Filter players with above-average performance or susceptibility
batters_recent_filtered <- batters_recent %>% filter(index > 1)
batters_filtered <- batters %>% filter(index > 1)
pitchers_filtered <- pitchers %>% filter(index > 1)

Example Calculation:
Player A: 25 HR in 500 PA → HR/PA = 0.05
League HR/PA = 0.035 → Batter Index = 0.05 ÷ 0.035 = 1.43

Pitcher B: 20 HR in 150 IP → HR/IP = 0.133
League HR/IP = 0.09 → Pitcher Index = 0.133 ÷ 0.09 = 1.48

Since both indices > 1.0, the matchup is flagged as high value.

High-Value Matchups:
# Combine batter data
good_batters <- inner_join(batters_filtered, batters_recent_filtered, by = "player_id")

# Filter today's pitchers
pitchers_today <- read_csv("~/Downloads/todays_pitchers_names_only.csv")
bad_pitchers <- inner_join(pitchers_filtered, pitchers_today, by = c("last_name", "first_name"))

# Select relevant columns
good_batters <- good_batters %>%
  select(last_name, first_name, player_id, ab, pa.x, pa.y, hit, home_run, hard_hit_percent)

bad_pitchers <- bad_pitchers %>%
  select(last_name, first_name, player_id, p_formatted_ip, home_run, hr_per_ip, 
         barrel_batted_rate, exit_velocity_avg, batting_avg)

These tables allow you to identify good batters versus susceptible pitchers using any MLB schedule. Additional metrics like hard hit % can be used to refine player selection.

# Results (08/09/2025):

Metric	Predicted	Actual
High Value Batters	3 of 13 correct
Good Batters	18 of 52 correct

The model captured several statistically advantageous matchups, demonstrating potential for predicting HR outcomes.

Conclusion: The model successfully identifies statistically favorable batter-pitcher matchups. Although Home Runs were used as the main example, the same framework can extend to other performance metrics. Limitations include small sample sizes and rapidly changing player performance. Future improvements could include incorporating park factors, weighting recent stats more heavily than season averages, using multiple metrics simultaneously, and implementing machine learning for enhanced predictions.
